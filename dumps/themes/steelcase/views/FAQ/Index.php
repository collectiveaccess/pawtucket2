			<strong>How can I best utilize the database?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many different search capabilities on here—take advantage of them! You can explore works by color, size, style/movement, artist, subject matter, location and more. Or simply enter search terms in the upper-right corner box. The art team has also curated featured collections and galleries so that you can learn about the art from different angles.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/><strong>Can I save works of interest and easily return to them?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes—it’s easy to create and save sets of works in the My Sets tab. You can also share sets with other users and groups by clicking on the gear next to your created set name.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/><strong>How do I request a work of art for temporary or permanent display use?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Contact the art team by clicking the envelope in the upper-right corner, or send an email directly to art@steelcase.com. Include the Steelcase-assigned asset number of each work you’re interested in, along with specifics of the requested use: location, purpose, length of display. You can also share sets of requested works with art@steelcase.com.
		</p>		
		<p>
			<br/><strong>What else do I need to know about the art request and loan process?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the art team has determined whether the requested works are available and suitable for use, we’ll set up a time to meet and show them to you in person. Use may be restricted by artwork value or requested display location.
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ll also need to complete an art loan agreement form outlining terms of use, responsibilities and project number to bill for all associated costs. These forms can be accessed in the database.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please allow adequate time to request, view and have works restored/reframed (if necessary), prior to your shipping deadline.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/><strong>What if I’m located outside of Grand Rapids?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The artwork request process will be the same, except that you won’t be able to view the work(s) in person prior to using them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that for all requested display use outside of the United States, you will need to complete an international art loan agreement form. Please also take a moment to read the guidelines for international art loans, which you can find in the international loan form record in the database.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/><strong>Can I reproduce artwork in the collection, either digitally or in print?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Works of art under copyright protection will require permission from the artist, the artist's estate/foundation, or the agency representing the artist's intellectual property rights. Please allow adequate time in your project schedule for requesting copyright permissions, which may take up to several weeks or longer. Contact the art team to learn more about how we can help facilitate these requests. 
 
Visit <a href="http://copyright.gov">copyright.gov</a> and <a href="http://arsny.com">arsny.com</a> for more information about copyright law and artists currently protected by copyright.

		<p>
			<br/><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Images of works in the database can be deceiving. Viewing the work(s) in person, if possible, will give you a better sense of color and scale, and also help determine whether restoration/reframing is needed. Sample swatches also help match colors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, send us your feedback! Use the contact form or email art@steelcase.com with suggestions on how to make the database work better for you and your project needs. The art team is also happy to meet with you and discuss possibilities for improvement.
