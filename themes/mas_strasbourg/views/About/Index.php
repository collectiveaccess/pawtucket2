			<h3>The Strasbourg and District Museum</h3>
		<p>Strasbourg and District Museum represents the district and its citizens, many of who donated to the museum. You’ll see them in the photograph collections. You’ll see and hear them on a video project between local seniors and a grade twelve class which captures stories from a bygone era. The many talents, the strong work ethic, the love of games, sports, music, the loyalty to God, to Queen and King and country are evident in each display. The household portion of the station has been restored to what it was in the early 1900’s. The business section is filled with display items from agriculture to wildlife and every aspect in between.</p>
		<p>This history is as fragile as the artifacts. Without work and care, time and effort to protect and preserve the lore of yesteryear it will crumble and be lost. The Board, with excellent support from our Town Council, local businesses, and the present history-making people are determined not to lose, but to preserve for today and for the future the vastly fascinating ways and times of the pioneers, the ancestors who began the town and the surrounding district of which we are so proud today.</p>
