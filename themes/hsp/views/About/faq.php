		<b><i>How do I purchase an image I see in the Digital Library?</i></b><br/>
		Digital images, archival prints, and permission to reproduce, publish, exhibit, or distribute these materials are available, for a fee, through our Rights and Reproductions department.  To purchase images, please <?php print caNavLink($this->request, "Login/Register", "", "", "LoginReg", "form"); ?> with a new or existing Digital Library account.  Once you are logged in, add images to your gallery, check off the requested services for each image, and click the “Purchase or Inquire about Items” link to submit your order.

		<b><i>How do I create a Digital Library account?</i></b><br/>
		To create image galleries, send and receive messages from the R&R Associate, and purchase reproductions, you must have a Digital Library account.  To create an account, click on the “<?php print caNavLink($this->request, "Login/Register", "", "", "LoginReg", "form"); ?>” link at the top of the page.  You will be prompted to enter your name and e-mail address and create a password.  Once you have an account, you can create image galleries and save images using the “Save Images to Gallery” link.

		<b><i>How do I use my gallery?</i></b><br/>
		When viewing an image record in the Digital Library, click the “Save Images to Gallery” link underneath an image to add it to one of your image galleries.  For records with multiple images, you can select specific images by clicking the “change” link once an image is added to your gallery.  When you click the “change” link, an image viewer will appear so you can select the images you are interested in via checkboxes on the right-hand side of the screen.  Once you have made your selections, click the X on the upper right-hand side of the screen to close the viewer.  Your selections are automatically saved as you make them, so no need to worry about losing your selections.

		<b><i>Why are prices listed for some services and not for others?</i></b><br/>
		Digital and print reproductions are priced according to a set fee schedule.  Possession of reproductions of HSP’s collection materials does not constitute permission to publish or exhibit.  Depending on how you wish to use an image, usage rights costs will apply and do vary.  To obtain a quote for usage rights, please provide the R&R Associate with as much information about your project as possible (title, publisher/producer/institution, print-run/units produced/term, etc.).
	</div>
	<div><a name="usage"></a>
		<b><i>Why would I need usage?</i></b><br/>
		All media and prints require a usage agreement, though materials used for personal purposes only, such as research or to hang in your living room, do not have a fee attached.  Our R&R Associate will work with you to determine the correct agreement for your needs and any applicable fees.  Common uses that may require a fee include publishing images in a book or on a website and displaying them in a business or exhibition.  These fees assist in the preservation, management, and maintenance of HSP’s collections.

		<b><i>How long will it take to get my digital image and/or print?</i></b><br/>
		Pre-payment by check or credit card is required for all reproductions orders.  You will receive an e-mail notification when your payment is ready to be processed.  Once payment is received, reproductions are delivered either through digital download or US postal service.  The demand for images varies greatly from day to day and the average turnaround time for new digitization is 2 weeks.   Rush service is available for an additional fee.   HSP reserves the right to refuse any reproduction request.

		<b><i>I'm a HSP member.  Do I get a discount?</i></b><br/>
		HSP members are entitled to image discounts. Please consult the details of our <a href="http://hsp.org/become-a-member/member-benefits">membership benefits</a> and be sure to mention your membership status and provide your member identification number before receiving an invoice.

		<b><i>What if I can’t find what I’m looking for?</i></b><br/>
		The images in our Digital Library are a small fraction of HSP’s vast manuscript and graphics collections, many of which are not yet digitized.  To purchase materials that do not appear in the Digital Library, <?php print caNavLink($this->request, "Login/Register", "", "", "LoginReg", "form"); ?> with a new or existing Digital Library account and create a new gallery to message our R&R Associate.
