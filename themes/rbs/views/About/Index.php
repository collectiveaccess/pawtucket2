		<p>In the fall of 2016, with funding provided by a grant from the Pine Tree Foundation, RBS completed the development of a new collections database—a robust, web-based catalogue built with open source software that uses browser-based Apache/PHP-generated interfaces to access a MySQL relational database. This project, led by Ruth-Ellen St. Onge and developed with the Brooklyn-based firm Whirl-i-Gig, has resulted in a catalogue that encompasses what were previously a number of separate, stand-alone Access databases. The new database includes the many custom features that we relied on in our previous Access databases, as well as new components, such as key terms, derived from RBMS Controlled Vocabularies, for tagging RBS collections. The new database, which readily allows for the inclusion of images and video, allows off-site faculty and staff to work more closely with our holdings, and to enrich them with customized teaching notes. We have dubbed this new catalogue “Silva” in honor of the Pine Tree Foundation and its Co-Trustee, Szilvia Szmuk-Tanenbaum. We are deeply grateful for the Foundation’s support.</p>
		<p>Beginning in 2017, RBS collections staff will be embarking on a large-scale project to catalog previously unprocessed materials, enrich metadata for existing records, and upload media to the database. </p>
