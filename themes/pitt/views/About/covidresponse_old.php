		<p>The health and safety of our visitors and staff are of primary importance to us. As such, the University Art Gallery (UAG) at the University of Pittsburgh is temporarily closed and on-site programs remain suspended until further notice. Our re-opening plans will follow the guidance and public health protocols issued by the University of Pittsburgh. In addition, we will continue to monitor guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State of Pennsylvania, and the City of Pittsburgh.</p>

		<p>We will post updates and reopening plans on this page.</p>
