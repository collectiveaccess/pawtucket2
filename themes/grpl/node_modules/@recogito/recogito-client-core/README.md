## Contributing UI Translations

If you want to contribute UI translations to Annotorious or RecogitoJS, you've come to the right place!
In [this folder](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-client-core/tree/main/src/i18n) 
you will find `messages` files, one file for each translation. 

Each `messages` file is a dictionary of the English labels and their translations. For example, 
here's the German translation file `messages_de.json`.

```json
{
  "Add a comment...": "Kommentar schreiben...",
  "Add a reply...": "Antwort schreiben...",
  "Add tag...": "Tag...",
  "Cancel": "Abbrechen",
  "Close": "Schliessen",
  "Edit": "Bearbeiten",
  "Delete": "LÃ¶schen",
  "Ok": "Ok"
}
``` 

### To add a new translation

- Fork this repository
- Add a message file to the [src/i18n folder](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-client-core/tree/main/src/i18n) 
  named `messages_{iso}.json`, where {iso} is the 2-character ISO code of the language.
- Copy the dictionary above, and replace the translations accordingly.
