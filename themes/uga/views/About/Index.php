		<h6>History</h6>
  

	<p>The Walter J. Brown Media Archive &amp; Peabody Awards Collection was started in 1995 and currently preserves over 250,000 titles in film, video, audiotape, transcription disks, and other recording formats dating from the 1920s to the present. The archives are housed in the <a href="http://www.libs.uga.edu/scl">Richard B. Russell Building Special Collections Libraries</a> on the northwest part of the University of Georgia campus. Our mission is to preserve, protect, and provide access to the moving image and sound materials that reflect the collective memory of broadcasting and the history of the state of Georgia and its people.</p>

		<h6>Our Collections</h6>
<p><a href="../Peabody/Index">The Peabody Awards Collection</a> is the flagship of the archives, and contains nearly every entry for the first major broadcast award given in the United States. Entries begin in 1940 for radio and 1948 for television, and we receive at least 1,000 new entries every year --programs by local, national, cable, and international producers. The collection provides a cultural cross-section of television from its infancy to the present day, featuring news, documentary, entertainment, educational, and children's programming. The judging for the <a href="http://www.peabodyawards.com/">Peabody Awards</a> is conducted by the Peabody Awards Office in the Grady School of Journalism from panel of distinguished television scholars, critics, and media professionals. The award ceremony is held every year in New York in late spring.</p>
