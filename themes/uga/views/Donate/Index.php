		<h3>Donate Materials</h3>
	
<p>The Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Collection welcomes additions to its collection of television, radio, music, amateur film and home movies, as well as artifacts related to each. The department currently preserves over 250,000 titles in film, video, audiotape, transcription discs, and other recording formats dating from the 1920s to the present with the goal of documenting the collective memory of broadcasting and the history of the state of Georgia and its people.</p>
