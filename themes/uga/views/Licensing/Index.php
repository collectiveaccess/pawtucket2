<p><strong>Research &amp; Stock Footage</strong><br>
  Producers and researchers can order stock footage from the collections at Walter J. Brown Media Archive & Peabody Awards Collection. The archive has a form for ordering clean footage.  Contact Ruta Abolins at <a href="mailto:abolins@uga.edu">abolins@uga.edu</a> or 706-542-4757. <br>
  The first half-hour of research is always free.

<p><strong>Screeners</strong><br>
  Screeners are made available via download with embedded watermark and timecode by downloading the item from the video screen in the item record. If the item has not been digitized click on "request item" at the bottom of the record for each item you are interested in. There is usually no charge. It generally takes 2-4 weeks from the time a request is submitted for a screener to be uploaded to our website.</p>

  If it is necessary to go to an outside vendor for duplication, laboratory or facility will be specified by the Walter J. Brown Media Archives &amp; Peabody Awards Collection. All costs of duplication must be paid by client. If an item must be digitized to higher resolution, such as 16mm newsfilm, a lab fee of $250.00 will be charged for each reel.</p>
