					One of ANSM's ongoing goals is to educate Nova Scotians about the value of museums and Nova Scotian stories. ANSM introduced NovaMuse to provide a place for museums to connect and showcase their collections, and for people to tell their part of the collective story of life in Nova Scotia. #Canada150 has now given ANSM the opportunity to further pursue its goal for education and outreach through the use of NovaMuse. ANSM is excited to introduce <b>Touchstones: Exploring Nova Scotia’s history in 150 years of confederation</b>. Touchstones is an exciting and innovative approach to engaging Nova Scotians in their history and celebration of 150 years of confederation.

					ANSM and its member museums are asking the public to select their favourite items from museum collections, to vote for the top #150Touchstones that helped shape Nova Scotia’s role in confederation and the evolution of Canada. Once the initial voting phase is over, the list of top 600 items will be shared with high school students, who will select and curate the final 150 artifacts that they feel best represent the project goals.

				<div>
					To vote for your favourite artifact, find its page and click on the <b>Vote #Canada150</b> button beneath the photo. You can browse through the artifacts by using the search box, the browse tab, or the theme buttons on the homepage. If you want to support a particular museum you can click on the contributor map button, locate your museum of choice, and then click on "see the collection" to browse through its collection. There are no limitations on voting, so enjoy exploring the collections and voting for as many artifacts as you would like, as often as you would like.
