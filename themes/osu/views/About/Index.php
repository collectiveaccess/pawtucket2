	<h3>About the Project</h3>
	<div class='dotDivide'></div>
	<p>The Charles A. Csuri Project is an initiative at The Ohio State University (OSU) that preserves, organizes and publicly disseminates a digital record of pioneering computer artist and Ohio State Emeritus Professor Charles A. Csuri's art, writings and significant life events. In 1995, Csuri was recognized in <em>Smithsonian Magazine</em> as the "father of digital art and computer animation," acknowledging the artist's pioneering role in the field of computer graphics.</p>
	<p>The Csuri Project's art and animations include both traditional and computer art from 1945 to present.  Works created by Csuri's students, particularly those associated with the Computer Graphics Research Group (CGRG) and Cranston/Csuri Productions, Inc. (CCP), are also preserved and disseminated through this project. As such, the project establishes a record of Csuri's scholarship, innovative research and unique teaching.</p>
	<p>The Csuri project's textual information is based on original research and extensive interviews with the artist and his colleagues. This information continues to be updated and expanded. The color images, animations and historical information are searchable through the Csuri Project database and browseable through a unique collection-based data management system called the Media Manager (MM).  This gives scholars, students and digital art enthusiasts a unique window into the art, life and professional career of a key leader in computer graphics history.</p>

	<h3>Csuri Project History</h3>
	<div class='dotDivide'></div>
	<p>The Charles A. Csuri Project was established as The Charles A. Csuri Archive in 1999 and became known as the Charles A. Csuri Project in 2007, when it was updated to include the research and knowledge gained from the <em>Charles A. Csuri: Beyond Boundaries 1963–present</em> retrospective exhibition that opened at SIGGRAPH 2006 in Boston. The online Csuri database was also created in 1999 and updated in 2007 in collaboration with the Web Media Collective (WMC) at OSU, who is responsible for the design and management of the Media Manager database software.</p>
