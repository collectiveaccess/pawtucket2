		<H5>About Susan Eley Fine Art</H5>
		<p>
			Susan Eley Fine Art was founded in the spring of 2006 by Susan Eisner Eley as a salon-style gallery. Situated in an Upper West Side townhouse in Manhattan, the Gallery offers an intimate viewing experience, contrary to the more formal presentations of art in typical white box galleries. Eley opened the Gallery to attract a new, untapped audience for contemporary art and to provide regular gallerygoers with a fresh, alternative way to enjoy art.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Gallery focuses on contemporary art by emerging and mid-career artists, who work in a range of media, from paint to photography to sculpture and print. Solo and group exhibitions showcase abstract and figurative work from a diverse body of artists from the US, Asia, Latin America and Europe. Gallery artists are dynamic, active professionals, who produce strong bodies of work that constantly shift and evolve.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the exhibition program, the Gallery regularly hosts collector talks, political fundraisers, <a href="http://www.vicamillersalons.com/" target="_blank">literary and poetry salons</a> and panel discussions on a variety of cultural and political topics. The Gallery has participated in art fairs in Miami, Houston, San Francisco, New York City and Saratoga Springs, and abroad in Toronto. SEFA has a strong online presence through platforms such as <a href="https://artsy.net/susan-eley-fine-art" target="_blank">artsy.net</a> and <a href="https://www.1stdibs.com/dealers/susan-eley-fine-art/?utm_source=susaneleyfineart.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dealer" target="_blank">1stdibs.com</a>.
