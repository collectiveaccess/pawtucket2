				There is not a singular residential school narrative. The history and legacy of residential schools is complex. Their impact on Survivors and Indigenous communities continues to be realized, and the colonial aspirations that established the schools continue. These <b>Narrative Threads</b> group together records and information about residential schools as a way to help build an understanding of Canadaâ€™s residential school system. While much of the content currently in the IRSHDC collections reflect government and church records and stories, it is necessary and important that Survivor voices and agency be prioritized in this work. This not a complete collection of threads; the intention is that through engagement, ongoing work and collaboration they will continue to grow.
