        <p>
            ANSM has a collection of museological resources available for use. 
            Members may borrow up to three items from the library at a time, for 
            a maximum of three months. Books may be requested online by clicking on the <em>request</em>
            link and filling out the form. ANSM will be responsible for delivering the 
            items and the borrower will be responsible for returning them. In the
            event that an item is lost or damaged, the borrower will cover the cost of replacement.
            Materials are not available for out-of-province loan.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Not a member? You can visit the ANSM office during open hours 
            (Monday-Friday, 9am-4pm) and use the reference library in person. We recommend that 
            you call ahead to ensure someone will be able to assist you during your visit.
