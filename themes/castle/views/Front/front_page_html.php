			<H1>Explore Craigdarroch’s Museum Collection</H1>
			<p>Welcome to our collection portal. From here you can explore the Castle’s artifacts and the stories they tell.  Most of the collection relates to the Dunsmuir family and the period they lived in Craigdarroch (1890-1908). A small portion of the collection relates to the various institutions that have occupied the Castle from 1919 to the present. You may wish to view our curated galleries related to the Dunsmuir family and highlighting the Castle’s occupancy periods. You can also perform your own basic or advanced searches. To create your own galleries using the lightbox feature or to leave comments about objects you see, create your own account in our system.</p>
