# Formatting of download file name.
# --------------------
# Can be one of the following:
# idno, idno_and_version, idno_and_rep_id_and_version, original_name
#
# You may also set this to a display template evaluated relative to representation being
# downloaded. Ex. "DOWNLOAD_^ca_object_representations.original_filename" will name the file
# using the originally uploaded file name prefixed with "DOWNLOAD_"; "^ca_object_representations.md5"
# will name the downloaded file with the MD5 checksum of the originally uploaded file.
# 
# Your template should not include an extension as it will be added to the end of your
# template. Values that include non-alphanumeric values such as mimetype will have those
# characters converted to underscores. You can surround tags with curly brackets {} to 
# ensure that your tags don't blend into the file name. An example template that 
# includes idno and original file name:
#
#      download_{^ca_object_representations.idno}<ifdef code='ca_object_representations.original_filename'>_{^ca_object_representations.original_filename}</ifdef>
#
# For TIFF media from object 2016.2 with an originally uploaded name of test_file.jpg this
# template will return the file name "download_2016_2_test_file.tiff"
#
# You can set the naming policy on a per-table basis (Eg. representations related to an object 
# can be named following one format and representations related to an occurrence another) using
# the <table name>_downloaded_file_naming directive (Ex. ca_objects_downloaded_file_naming = idno_and_version)

# You can set a global policy to be applied if a table-specific policy is not defined using the
# downloaded_file_naming directive.

# and usable in templates under their name (Eg. {{{operating_hours}}} in the example below).
#

# of the element; usewysiwygeditor enables a "wysiwyg" rich text editor for formatted text.
