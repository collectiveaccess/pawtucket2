        <p>San Felipe el Real was an Augustinian monastery, founded in 1547 with the encouragement of crown prince Philip (later Philip II). It stood on a low mound or platform in the calle Mayor between the calle de Esparteros and the calle del Correo. Steps led up to a kind of esplanade, on which the monastery church stood. The main entrance to the church faced the calle de Esparteros, and in front of the entrance was the “Lonja de la Entrada de la Yglesia.” On the north (calle Mayor) side was the “Lonja Grande.” [1] The sloping ground allowed galleries (covachuelas) to be constructed under the lonja grande, and early prints show doorways opening from the calle Mayor into this space. These covachuelas were rented out by the monks, and one of the few sets of accounts to have survived shows that from 1783 to 1786 the total rent for eighteen covachuelas exceeded 10,000 reales a year (Sánchez Espinosa, p. 145). In addition to these covachuelas, Dr. Sánchez Espinosa suggests that the awnings that can be seen projecting from the wall of the church provided protection for more stalls, and that there were even more bookshops in the nearby streets (pp. 148–9).</p>
        <p>Early modern Madrid had several “mentideros”: places where madrileños met to gossip and exchange news, and the Gradas de San Felipe were a favorite one of these. The presence of stalls and kiosks selling a wide variety of goods, including toys and printed ephemera such as newsletters, plays and playlets, was an added attraction, and we find various forms of the address in colophons: “frente a San Felipe el Real,” “frente las gradas de San Felipe el Real,” “en las gradas de San Felipe el Real,” “en su puesto, gradas de San Felipe el Real.”</p>
        <p>It should be noted that San Felipe was only a short distance from another favorite suelta-vending area: the “lonja de comedias de la Puerta del Sol.” [2] Dr. Ulla Lorenzo’s study makes use of the advertisements in the Gaceta de Madrid to show that there were numerous such areas in the central part of the city.</p>
        <p>The monastery of San Felipe el Real suffered extensive damage when it was taken over to accommodate French troops during the War of Independence. It was closed in 1835 and pulled down in 1838. [DWC]</p>

        <p>The same portrait is also reproduced in Francisco Vindel’s Manual de conocimientos técnicos y culturales para profesionales del libro. This is Vindel’s comment on the portrait (p. 87): “En la calle de Carretas hubo una librera a quien retrató Goya; he procurado investigar de quién se trataba, y como resultado he obtenido que desde 1778 hasts 1800 hubo dos libreras en la calle de Carretas, que fueron la viuda de Corradi, en 1778, y en 1794 la viuda de Piferrer, y yo creo que seguramante esta última fué la que retrató, y el llamarla famosa fué a causa de que en la calle de Carretas había las siguientes librerías: Blanques Martínez, Escribano, Francés Bailo, Hurtado, Bravo, Tieso, Gómez, Orcel, Campis y la citada viuda de Piferrer, y seguramente era notable una librería regentada por una mujer, entre tantas otras, o porque era muy bella, según se ve n el retrato que de ella hizo.”</p>

        <p>The Baixada is now a short street lined with massive stone walls. There are no stores—in fact, there are no openings at all in the walls. It is likely that the length and other characteristics of the street were altered by the extensive transformation that began in Barcelona in 1913, in preparation for the 1929 World Exposition, and that affected the Cathedral and the entire area around it.</p>',

It is obvious that this image strays from strict framework of this exhibition, however, the connections are too tempting to resist: we meet Cervantes’ 17th-century hero in the 18th-century print shop that published the novel.</p>
        <p>This engraving of Don Quixote visiting a print shop in Barcelona comes from Sancha’s 1797 edition of Part II. The scene, like the novel, is full of references to real-life characters as well as to fictional ones. The image is rich in details related to printing: a man in the background on the right is setting type (composing stick in his left hand, picking type from the case with his raised right hand); in the background, on the left, a printer is lifting off a sheet from the bed of the press. The gentleman wearing a turban, at the back left, is Antonio de Sancha, who is recognizable from his often-reproduced portrait. The younger, bewigged man directly in front of him is most likely his son, Gabriel, who carried on the business. The event, which in the novel takes place in Barcelona, has been transposed to Madrid, the location being identifiable by the sign over the door that reads “Imprenta de Sancha.”</p>
        <p>It is an engraving by Juan Moreno Tejada (1738–1805) after a composition designed by Luis Paret y Alcázar (1746–1799). The original drawing in this case survives in the Biblioteca Nacional (BNE DIB/15/54/13).</p>
