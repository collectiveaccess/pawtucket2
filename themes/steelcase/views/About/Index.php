			Bob Pew in front of James Rosati's<br/>Ode IV (1983) at Global Headquarters

		<p>
			It was the early 1980s and construction for the Steelcase Global Headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan was underway. During this expansion Chairman and CEO Bob Pew embraced the opportunity to grow the company’s art collection displayed in Steelcase facilities and plants around the country.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the belief that art made “a positive and lasting contribution to the quality of daily work life”, Steelcase purchased hundreds of works to enhance the new building and inspire employees. Functional architecture and beautiful design became integrated with fine and decorative arts from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. Robert Forrest, President of Forrest Designers Ltd and Forrest Fine Arts, and John Lloyd Taylor, Director of The Fine Arts Galleries at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, assisted in the selection and placement of works to create an aesthetically pleasing environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the next two decades the Steelcase art collection continued to grow, reflecting a variety of styles and movements, cultures and eras, by artists both local and internationally renowned. Today Steelcase offices and showrooms around the globe exhibit many of these early purchases, from paintings and sculptures to prints, drawings and more. And employee and customer appreciation for the artwork is very much alive, with visitors often tweeting images of artwork experienced during tours.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Steelcase Art digital collection was born in 2014 with two goals: give access to employees in search of artwork to complement new and redesigned office facilities and showrooms, and offer Steelcase employees a deeper dive into our company’s unique collection.

			Take a moment to look around. Explore works in storage and on display. Find out what makes Steelcase an innovative organization that continues to place a high value on the role of art in business, and as a vital part of the human experience.
