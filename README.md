CollectiveAccess Pawtucket README
---------------------------------

Thanks for downloading CollectiveAccess Pawtucket version 2.0!

Pawtucket is general purpose public-access publishing tool for
CollectiveAccess. It provides an easy way to create web sites around data
entered into CollectiveAccess using the Providence cataloguing tool. Pawtucket
provides many features for displaying, finding and interacting with
collections information, including:

   1. Full text search with auto-suggestion functionality
   2. Configurable faceted browse
   3. Ability to browse within search results (aka. "refine your search")
   4. Configurable detail displays for collection objects and all authorities-
you can show as much or as little information from your database as you want
   5. Support for "features" - simple online exhibitions using curator-defined
sets. System is extensible so you can define your own feature-types.
   6. Support for user-created tags, comments, ratings and object slideshows
   7. Not object-centric. While objects are usually the focus of a collections
front-end, with Pawtucket they don't have to be. You can search and browse in
any authority in addition to collection objects. This lets Pawtucket work in
specialized applications such as biographical catalogues (people are the focus
rather than objects) and collection-level archival finding aids (collections
are the focus rather than objects) 

Pawtucket is meant to be customized. The download version includes a basic
default theme that supports all functionality but is visually quite plain. By
editing the CSS stylesheet and system header and footer templates you can have
Pawtucket fit into most any existing design scheme.
